## Introduction

In  a  world   where   data   is   constantly   being generated,   it' s   essential   to   track   and   analyze this   data   to   clean   valuable   insights.   Data tracking   can   help   you   understand   trends, optimize   processes,   and   make   better   decisions.

The ability to monitor a specific person using this system is highly helpful to everyone, but schools in particular.   In terms of monitoring attendance, the time-in and time-out feature, and maintenance, our teacher tracking system is user-friendly. The administrator of this system is able to update both the teacher's attendance records and their personal data. Teacher account logs (login, logout) allows the user to keep track of all of the teachers.

In order for teacher tracking systems to be implemented successfully, a number of critical issues need to be resolved, according to research. Data security and privacy are two major issues. These systems gather and preserve teachers' personal data, attendance logs, and performance reviews, which raises questions about illegal access and improper use of sensitive information. Trust and compliance with privacy laws depend on protecting privacy while upholding the appropriate data integrity and security precautions.

This study looks into the main issues with teacher tracking systems and suggests solutions for their successful adoption in order to fill the gaps mentioned above. This study intends to offer insightful information and recommendations to assist educational institutions in implementing and optimizing teacher monitoring systems by examining privacy issues, investigating teacher perspectives, evaluating technical needs, and taking into account the ethical use of data.
